            <h1>Rewrite 2: Electric Boogaloo</h1>
            <p>I had fancy plans for last rewrite, but it barely worked out as planned.<br>
            So instead of still relying on extensive use of JS and copy-pasting, I've decided it's finally time to move on to a better solution.<br><br>
            My new idea is using Jekyll for the whole site: I've been reading its documentation for a couple of days now, and it seems like working with it will save me a ton of time.<br>
            Plus, it supports blogging right off the bat. I believe the posts system will be more than good enough for pretty much everything I plan on dumping on my site: art, projects and - obviously - a decent blog.</p>

                <h1>Rewrite in progress</h1>
                <p>The Froggy Shrine is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to achieve goals including, but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(Finally) being mobile-friendly.</li>
                    <li>Less hardcoding.</li>
                    <li>Optimization of the News/Blog section.</li>
                    <li>A new overall appearance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Want to visit <a href="OLD/index.html">the old site</a>? It's still there, just keep in mind that because of the rewrite, some things might not work as they should.</p>
                <h1>Wallpapers page fixes</h1>
             <p>I have fixed an oversight in <a>the wallpapers page</a> that prevented the download of FHD wallpapers.
                    <br>Now you should be able to install HD and FHD wallpapers alike.
                    <br>As a little extra, I have changed how the page works on mobile devices for a better experience across different platforms.
